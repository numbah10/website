  </p>The two snails in my aquarium go by the common name Mystery Snails or Apple Snails. They grow to be about two inches long, and are very helpful with algae cleanup. The picture above is a photo of my tank. You can see one of the snails at the top right by the thermometer. The other snail is purple in color.</p>
